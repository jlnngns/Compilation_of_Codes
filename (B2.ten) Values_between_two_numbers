# Ask the user to input two numbers
first_number = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
second_number = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Determine the start and end points
start = min(first_number, second_number)    # Get the smaller number
end = max(first_number, second_number)     # Get the larger number
